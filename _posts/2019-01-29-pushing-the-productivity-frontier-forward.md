# Pushing the Productivity Frontier Forward

*This blogpost was written as part of the coursework for my MSBA Program at UC Davis to reflect on factors that drive team productivity in the context of the practicum project*

The starting point of what makes a great team is often the composition of people. Having the right mix of people with complementary personalities and skill sets makes a more promising team. Many times, however, we find ourselves placed in ready formed teams. Our practicum team is one example and it will likely be the case as well when you enter the work force. Given the circumstances then, how can we improve the productivity of our teams?

To really understand how we can improve productivity, we first need to decompose this terminology and understand what drives productivity. Michael Porter, an academia who is well known for his economic and business theories, developed the productivity frontier concept, one that is often thought in economics 101 classes. While it is often used to explain production of goods and services, perhaps we can apply it as well to driving team productivity.

Based on the original concept, Porter describes productivity to be driven by a buy value (Y-axis) and an efficient cost of labor (X-axis). In a consulting type of setting, we can imagine our goods to be the value of insights and any analytics products that is provided to our clients, while the cost would refer to the billable hours being put into delivering the output. Productivity then can be thought of as a combination of effectiveness and efficiency. Doing the right thing in the right way to optimize the outcome.

To provide some context, I find it easier to think about the work we deliver bench marked against a typical week. An improvement in productivity would then mean that we can provide our client with the same level of output using a shorter amount of time in a week, or that we can provide more value to our client using the same number of working hours in a week.

**Improving Effectiveness (Y-Axis) - Do less and obsess**

An idea that could be borrowed from Morten Hansen’s book, Great at Work, is to do less and obsess. In his research on 5000 participants, it was found that the group that performed worst was the one who took on multiple priorities. Instead of spreading yourself out thinly, it is suggested that it is better to focus on fewer tasks, and then obsess about making them great!

For the practicum with Lucky, we were presented with 3 areas of focus, store clustering, audience profiling and store clustering. Given our unfamiliarity with the subject, we decided to tackle one at a time while building domain knowledge. While it was probably not a conscious to do less and obsess, this seems reflective about how our team has been doing. The last few weeks has been one of obsession, where we replay, reflect, and revise our methodology step by step in every meeting to ensure that we have a sound recommendation that we can stand by.

Another area where we can do less and obsess is in presenting effective power point slides. Comparing the length of our weekly update slides from the first few weeks of our practicum to the recent ones, we have certainly reduced the number of slides being created as we now have a clear goal of refining our method and not just regurgitating every piece of information that we had created a chart or table for. One way that our team can continue to focus on creating compelling slides is to reflect on what slides were quickly passed on in a meeting, and which ones elicited meaningful discussions with our MIP.

**Improving Efficiency (X-Axis) – Reduce costly meetings**

*“A meeting is a place where you keep the minutes and throw away the hours.”  by Thomas Kayser (Author of Building Team Power)*

Inc, an online meeting company, estimates that over $37billion dollars are spent in a year on unproductive meetings. It is also not uncommon to hear about people dreading to attend a meeting that they find pointless. That is not to say though that there should be no meetings. There needs to be a ground for communication, coordination and brainstorming so that we can reap the benefits of operating as a team.

*"We meet because people holding different jobs have to cooperate to get a specific task done. We meet because the knowledge and experience needed in a specific situation are not available in one head, but have to be pieced together out of the knowledge and experience of several people." by Peter Drucker (Management Consultant and Author)*

How can than can we ensure productive meetings? There are many different articles that provide a list of tips to ensure a more efficient meeting. Among which, 2 that I strongly identify with based on my practicum experience in the a last few months is to meet face to face as well as to leave a meeting with clear action points to follow up. These were 2 points that our team has done more of this quarter and we have certainly seen a boost in our efficiency. That said, our weekly meetings do run on the longer side. Many online sources suggest keeping meetings short, with one article saying 15 mins and another 22 mins. With our meetings now taking up to 2 hours, there seems to be some opportunity here to further optimize. Given that the nature of our meetings involves much brainstorming, I do not think that a 15-minute session would suffice. Perhaps we could consider a hybrid model where we allocate a fix amount of time for brainstorming, and another 15 minutes for additional updates and delegation of tasks.

Efficiency and effectiveness work hand in hand to create productive teams. While we may not be able to always put a number to how well we are faring in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, we tend to have a hunch as to how well things are going. Take a pulse check of the room in your next meeting and actively experiment new ways to engage everyone to inch towards a more productive team!
